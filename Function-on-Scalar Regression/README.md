This folder should consist of one .RData file and two .R files, including: 


1. asfr.RData: the age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) data set.

2. FoS_reg_functions.R: includes the main functions to impletment the neural network-based (NN-based) function-on-scalar (FoS) regression models (NNBB, NNSS, NNBR & NNSR) proposed in the manuscript "Neural Networks for Scalar Input and Functional Output", along with two existing models (FoS linear and FAM). This file needs to be sourced.

3. FoS_reg_demo.R: contains the R codes for analyzing the age-specific fertility rate data set using the NN-based models (NNBB, NNSS, NNBR & NNSR) and the tranditional approaches (FoS linear and FAM).
